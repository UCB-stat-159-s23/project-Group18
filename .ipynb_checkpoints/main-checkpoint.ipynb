In addition to air pollutants, we also want to see how other factors, including green space access and education level, affect people's performance in Stroop test. A Stroop test measures a person's cognitive function by assessing their attention capacity and processing abilities. \n",

    "\n",
    "Plotting performance by individuals over time, we notice that individuals are recorded over different periods of time. Performance tends to moves up and down quite a bit for each individual. Next, we quantify how much performance tends to range for individuals. \n",

    "\n",
    "The graph above shows the distribution of the difference between the maximum and minimum performance score per individual - the range of performance range for individuals. The mean is around 20, which means that mental health performance does in fact range quite a bit for each individual on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we plot the mean performance for all individuals over time and compare this with the N02 levels over time, a measure of air quality, to examine whether they tend to have the same trends over time. \n",

    "\n",

Since our null hypothesis assumes that education has nothing do with mental health, we decided to perform A/B testing because if the null hypothesis is true, the difference in average performance, stress level, and occurrence of mental health issue would be just 0 regardless of the education level. Using the 0.05 as a significance level, we were able to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in average occurrence of mental health issue between people with university degree and people with baccalaureate. However, we failed to reject the null hypotheses that there is no difference in average occurrence between people with university degree and people with primary or less education background, and also same for people with baccalaureate and people with primary or less education. We failed to reject the null hypotheses that there is no difference in average stress level for people with university, baccalaureate, and primary or less education. On the other hand, we rejected the null hypotheses that there is no difference in average performance for people with those education backgrounds. "
